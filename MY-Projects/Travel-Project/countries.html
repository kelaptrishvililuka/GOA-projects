        <h2>Georgia</h2>
        <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/10-must-see-visit-georgia/">The best place to visit</a>
        <p>Georgia (Georgian: საქართველო, romanized: sakartvelo, IPA: [sakʰartʰʷelo] ⓘ) is a transcontinental country in
            Eastern Europe[10][11][12] and West Asia. It is part of the Caucasus region, bounded by the Black Sea to the
            west, Russia to the north and northeast, Turkey to the southwest, Armenia to the south, and Azerbaijan to
            the southeast. Georgia covers an area of 69,700 square kilometres (26,900 sq mi).[13] It has a population of
            3.7 million,[b][14] of which over a third live in the capital and largest city, Tbilisi. Georgians, who are
            native to the region, constitute a majority of the country's population and are its titular nation.

            Georgia has been inhabited since prehistory, hosting the world's earliest known sites of winemaking, gold
            mining, and textiles.[15][16] The classical era saw the emergence of several kingdoms, such as Colchis and
            Iberia, that formed the nucleus of the modern Georgian state. In the early fourth century, Georgians
            officially adopted Christianity, which contributed to the unification into the Kingdom of Georgia. Georgia
            reached its Golden Age during the High Middle Ages under the reigns of King David IV and Queen Tamar.
            Beginning in the 15th century, the kingdom declined and disintegrated under pressure from various regional
            powers, including the Mongols, the Ottoman Empire, and Persia, before being gradually annexed into the
            Russian Empire starting in 1801.

            After the Russian Revolution in 1917, Georgia briefly emerged as an independent republic under German
            protection,[17] but was invaded and annexed by the Red Army in 1921, becoming one of the Republics of the
            Soviet Union. In the 1980s, an independence movement grew quickly, leading to Georgia's secession from the
            Soviet Union in April 1991. For much of the subsequent decade, the country endured economic crises,
            political instability, and secessionist wars in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Following the peaceful Rose
            Revolution in 2003, Georgia strongly pursued a pro-Western foreign policy, introducing a series of
            democratic and economic reforms aimed at integration into the European Union and NATO. This Western
            orientation led to worsening relations with Russia, culminating in the Russo-Georgian War of 2008 and
            continued Russian occupation of parts of Georgia.

            Georgia is a representative democracy governed as a unitary parliamentary republic.[18][19] It is a
            developing country, with a very high Human Development Index and an emerging market economy. Sweeping
            economic reforms since 2003 have resulted in one of the freest business climates in the world, greater
            economic freedom and transparency, and among the fastest rates of GDP growth.[20] In 2018, Georgia became
            the second country in the world to legalize cannabis, and the first former socialist state to do so. Georgia
            is a member of numerous international organizations, including the Council of Europe, Eurocontrol, BSEC,
            GUAM, Energy Community. As part of the Association Trio, Georgia is a candidate for membership in the
            European Union.</p>
