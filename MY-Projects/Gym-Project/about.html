            Neglecting core and flexibility: These are vital for overall strength and injury prevention.
            10. Staying Motivated
            Track your progress (photos, weights lifted, running times).
            Join gym classes or group workouts for variety.
            Reward yourself for achieving milestones (e.g., new gear, a cheat meal).
            Remember, consistency is more important than perfection!

            Start with simple full-body workouts 3 times a week. Focus on learning proper techniques and gradually
            increase intensity.
