        <p id="bleach"><mark><em>Bleach</em></mark> is a Japanese anime and manga series created by Tite Kubo. It follows
            the story of <b>Ichigo Kurosaki</b>, a teenager who gains the powers of a Soul Reaper—a death personification
            tasked with defending humans from evil spirits known as Hollows and guiding the souls of the deceased to the
            afterlife. The manga was serialized in Shueisha's <em>Weekly Shōnen Jump</em> from August 2001 to August
            2016 and has been compiled into 74 volumes. The anime adaptation aired from 2004 to 2012, with a new arc
            titled <b>"Thousand-Year Blood War"</b> starting in 2022.</p>
        <p>Bleach is known for its dynamic fight scenes, well-developed characters, and a unique blend of action,
            drama, and supernatural elements. The series has a dedicated global fanbase and has inspired movies,
            novels, and video games.</p>

        <h3>One of the most powerful abilities in Bleach is called <b>"Bankai"</b></h3>
        <p><b>"Bankai"</b> is the ultimate form of a Soul Reaper's Zanpakutō (spiritual sword). Achieving Bankai requires
            years of training and greatly enhances the user's powers, granting them unique and devastating abilities.
            Each Soul Reaper's Bankai is unique, reflecting their bond with their Zanpakutō.</p>
